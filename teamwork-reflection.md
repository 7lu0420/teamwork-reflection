Below,
briefly describe the specific contributions each team member
made to your project (**including yourself**).
Point form is fine.
Specifically,
comment on the following areas:

- How the team worked together as a whole, including:
1. What was your role in the group?That is, what sort of things did you do to contribute to the evolution of the project?
    
Our dash has three pages, I am responsible for the code writing and drawing ideas for the artist page. Besides that, I am also responsible for the heroku deployment of all pages.

2. What were the roles of others in your group?
    
Nyx was responsible for the track page, in addition to writing the team's reflections and other documents. yuhong was responsible for writing the lyric page and the overall framework of the interface. It can be said that our group's tasks are very evenly distributed.

3. What went well and poorly throughout the team project experience?

The process of determining the analysis topic was quickly agreed upon, with each member taking a keen interest in music analysis, and actively communicating out a very specific application scenario.In order to take advantage of teamwork, others actively cooperate with the discussion and help debug when it comes to some difficulties encountered. In addition to each person being responsible for an analysis page, other extra tasks were distributed almost equally, such as overall layout code, deployment code, etc.

70% of the time spent on data wrangling and cleaning for some similar ditto problems.Debug caused more time than we expected: Multiple modules, such as plotly, altair, pandas and CSS, HTML are used to implemented. There happened failures due to version adaptation differences among those modules.
